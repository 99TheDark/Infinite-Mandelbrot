# Infinite Mandelbrot
A project for school, revisited the Mandelbrot set. Uses arbitrary precision for the Mandelbrot Set by [K.I. Martin](http://www.science.eclipse.co.uk/sft_maths.pdf), implementation largely from [iq](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttVSDW).

By forcing the orbit point within the Mandelbrot set, there is a seemless transition.
